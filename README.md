## Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro technique is an effective study method developed in the 1980s to aid in effective work. This project grants the user access to a customizable Pomodoro timer that the user may customize as needed

The timer is a React app that is broken up into 3 components:

## - ProgressBar
This component controls the progress bar that displays during a session in order to indicate how much time has elapsed.
## - Countdown
This component controls the visual numerical countdown that displays during a session in order to indictae how much time has elapsed.
## - Pomodoro
This is the main component that is rendered in the App.js file. It provides functions that are used by the other components as props, and it regulates user input in customizing the focus and break time durations.
